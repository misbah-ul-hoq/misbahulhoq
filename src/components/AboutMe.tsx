        Hi! I&apos;m a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for design
        and user experience. I specialize in building responsive, dynamic
        websites and applications using modern technologies like React, Tailwind
        CSS, and JavaScript. My focus is on creating clean, efficient code while
        delivering seamless, user-friendly interfaces. I enjoy working with
        tools like React Hook Form, Axios, and Firebase, and I&apos;m always
        eager to learn and implement the latest trends in web development. When
        I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m exploring new problem-solving techniques
        and enhancing my skills in data structures and algorithms.
      </p>
